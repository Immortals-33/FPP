# FPP
This is a repository for **FPP** (Filtering Pipeline for Proteins).

Computational protein design (CPD) is high-throughput and usually produces thousands of sequences, which is not realistic for _in vitro_ or _in vivo_ validation. Meanwhile, the relationship between success cases in wet lab experiments and _in silico_ metrics is obscure.   

Inspired by this, this pipeline is developed intending to filter as many as irrational seequences out to help improve the success rate in wet lab expriments.  

Note that this is an ongoing project and many work still needs to be done.
