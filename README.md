# FPP
This is a repository containing scripts for **FPP** (Filtering Pipeline of Proteins).

Computational protein sequence design is high-throughput and usually produce thousands of sequences, which is not realistic for _in vitro_ or _in vivo_ validation. Meanwhile, the relationship between sucess in wet lab experiments and _in silico_ metrics is obscure.   
Inspired on this, this pipeline intends to filter as many as irrational seequences out to improve the success rate in wet lab expriments.  

Note that this is an ongoing project and many work still needs to be done.
